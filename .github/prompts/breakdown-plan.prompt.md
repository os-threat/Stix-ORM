# GitHub Issue Planning & Project Automation Prompt

## Goal

Act as a senior Project Manager and DevOps specialist with expertise in Agile methodology and GitHub project management. Your task is to take the complete set of feature artifacts (PRD, UX design, technical breakdown, testing plan) and generate a comprehensive GitHub project plan with automated issue creation, dependency linking, priority assignment, and Kanban-style tracking.

## GitHub Project Management Best Practices

### Agile Work Item Hierarchy

- **Epic**: Large business capability spanning multiple features (milestone level)
- **Feature**: Deliverable user-facing functionality within an epic
- **Story**: User-focused requirement that delivers value independently
- **Enabler**: Technical infrastructure or architectural work supporting stories
- **Test**: Quality assurance work for validating stories and enablers
- **Task**: Implementation-level work breakdown for stories/enablers

### Project Management Principles

- **INVEST Criteria**: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- **Definition of Ready**: Clear acceptance criteria before work begins
- **Definition of Done**: Quality gates and completion criteria
- **Dependency Management**: Clear blocking relationships and critical path identification
- **Value-Based Prioritization**: Business value vs. effort matrix for decision making

## Input Requirements

Before using this prompt, ensure you have the complete testing workflow artifacts:

### Core Feature Documents

1. **Feature PRD**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}.md`
2. **Technical Breakdown**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/technical-breakdown.md`
3. **Implementation Plan**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/implementation-plan.md`

### Related Planning Prompts

- **Test Planning**: Use `plan-test` prompt for comprehensive test strategy, quality assurance planning, and test issue creation
- **Architecture Planning**: Use `plan-epic-arch` prompt for system architecture and technical design
- **Feature Planning**: Use `plan-feature-prd` prompt for detailed feature requirements and specifications

## Output Format

Create two primary deliverables:

1. **Project Plan**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/project-plan.md`
2. **Issue Creation Checklist**: `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/issues-checklist.md`

### Project Plan Structure

#### 1. Project Overview

- **Feature Summary**: Brief description and business value
- **Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes and KPIs
- **Key Milestones**: Breakdown of major deliverables without timelines
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential blockers and mitigation strategies

#### 4. Priority and Value Matrix

| Priority | Value  | Criteria                        | Labels                            |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| P0       | High   | Critical path, blocking release | `priority-critical`, `value-high` |
| P1       | High   | Core functionality, user-facing | `priority-high`, `value-high`     |
| P1       | Medium | Core functionality, internal    | `priority-high`, `value-medium`   |
| P2       | Medium | Important but not blocking      | `priority-medium`, `value-medium` |
| P3       | Low    | Nice to have, technical debt    | `priority-low`, `value-low`       |

#### 5. Estimation Guidelines

- **1 point**: Simple change, <4 hours
- **2 points**: Small feature, <1 day
- **3 points**: Medium feature, 1-2 days
- **5 points**: Large feature, 3-5 days
- **8 points**: Complex feature, 1-2 weeks
- **13+ points**: Epic-level work, needs breakdown

##### T-Shirt Sizing (Epics/Features)

- **XS**: 1-2 story points total
- **S**: 3-8 story points total
- **M**: 8-20 story points total
- **L**: 20-40 story points total
- **XL**: 40+ story points total (consider breaking down)

#### 6. Dependency Management

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Epic Planning] --> B[Feature Definition]
    B --> C[Enabler Implementation]
    C --> D[Story Development]
    D --> E[Testing Execution]
    E --> F[Feature Delivery]

    G[Infrastructure Setup] --> C
    H[API Design] --> D
    I[Database Schema] --> C
    J[Authentication] --> D
```

##### Dependency Types

- **Blocks**: Work that cannot proceed until this is complete
- **Related**: Work that shares context but not blocking
- **Prerequisite**: Required infrastructure or setup work
- **Parallel**: Work that can proceed simultaneously

#### 7. Sprint Planning Template

##### Sprint Capacity Planning

- **Team Velocity**: {Average story points per sprint}
- **Sprint Duration**: {2-week sprints recommended}
- **Buffer Allocation**: 20% for unexpected work and bug fixes
- **Focus Factor**: 70-80% of total time on planned work

##### Sprint Goal Definition

```markdown
## Sprint {N} Goal

**Primary Objective**: {Main deliverable for this sprint}

**Stories in Sprint**:

- #{issue} - {Story title} ({points} pts)
- #{issue} - {Story title} ({points} pts)

**Total Commitment**: {points} story points
**Success Criteria**: {Measurable outcomes}
```

#### 8. GitHub Project Board Configuration

##### Column Structure (Kanban)

1. **Backlog**: Prioritized and ready for planning
2. **Sprint Ready**: Detailed and estimated, ready for development
3. **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
4. **In Review**: Code review, testing, or stakeholder review
5. **Testing**: QA validation and acceptance testing
6. **Done**: Completed and accepted

##### Custom Fields Configuration
