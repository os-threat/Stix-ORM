# STIX-ORM GitHub Prompts Directory

## Overview
This directory contains prompts, specifications, and learning resources used for AI-assisted development of the STIX-ORM framework. These files provide context, requirements, and implementation guidance for complex development tasks.

## File Structure

### Technical Specifications

#### ðŸ“‹ **[create-clean-stix-list-module.md](create-clean-stix-list-module.md)**
- **Purpose**: Complete technical specification for the STIX object cleaning module
- **Content**: 7-operation pipeline requirements, conditional enrichment, dependency sorting
- **Usage**: Primary specification for `clean_list_or_bundle.py` implementation
- **Key Features**:
  - Conditional enrichment system with external source integration
  - Dynamic dependency detection and sorting
  - Comprehensive error reporting and failure handling
  - Performance optimization and timing requirements

### Learning and Context Files

#### ðŸŒ± **[seed-learning.md](seed-learning.md)**
- **Purpose**: Learning context and development guidance for AI assistants
- **Content**: Project background, implementation patterns, and development guidelines
- **Usage**: Provides context for understanding the STIX-ORM framework architecture

## Purpose and Usage

### For AI-Assisted Development
These prompts provide:
- Detailed technical requirements for complex implementations
- Context about existing architecture and patterns
- Specific implementation constraints and requirements
- Quality standards and validation criteria

### For Human Developers
These files serve as:
- Technical specification references
- Implementation requirement documentation
- Development context and background information
- Quality standards and acceptance criteria

### For Project Maintenance
The prompts directory helps with:
- Preserving implementation requirements and specifications
- Maintaining consistency across development iterations
- Providing context for future enhancements and modifications
- Documenting the reasoning behind specific implementation decisions

## File Categories

### **Specifications** ðŸ“‹
Files containing detailed technical requirements and implementation specifications.

### **Context** ðŸ§ 
Files providing background knowledge, architectural understanding, and development context.

### **Learning** ðŸŽ“
Files designed to help AI assistants understand the project structure, patterns, and implementation approaches.

## Integration with Project Documentation

The prompts directory complements:

- **[../instructions/](../instructions/)**: Critical implementation patterns and anti-patterns
- **[../../blueprint.md](../../blueprint.md)**: System architecture and design
- **[../../docs/](../../docs/)**: User-facing documentation and guides
- **[../../clean_list_or_bundle.md](../../clean_list_or_bundle.md)**: Module-specific documentation

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update Prompts
- Major feature additions or modifications
- Discovery of new requirements or constraints
- Changes to implementation patterns or standards
- Updates to system architecture or design

### Content Standards
- Include specific technical requirements and constraints
- Provide clear acceptance criteria and validation standards
- Reference existing architecture and implementation patterns
- Document any dependencies or integration requirements

### Version Control
- Update prompts when specifications change
- Maintain backward compatibility references when possible
- Document breaking changes or requirement modifications
- Preserve historical context for major design decisions
