attack-pattern.png,attack-pattern-table.csv,attack-pattern,Attack-Pattern,"Attack Patterns are a type of TTP that describe ways that adversaries attempt to compromise targets. Attack Patterns are used to help categorize attacks, generalize specific attacks to the patterns that they follow, and provide detailed information about how attacks are performed. An example of an attack pattern is ""spear phishing"": a common type of attack where an attacker sends a carefully crafted e-mail message to a party with the intent of getting them to click a link or open an attachment to deliver malware. Attack Patterns can also be more specific; spear phishing as practiced by a particular threat actor (e.g., they might generally say that the target won a contest) can also be an Attack Pattern.",The Attack Pattern SDO contains textual descriptions of the pattern along with references to externally-defined taxonomies of attacks such as CAPEC [CAPEC].,https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_axjijf603msy,"{

Locations are primarily used to give context to other SDOs. For example, a Location could be used in a relationship to describe that the Bourgeois Swallow intrusion set originates from Eastern Europe.

The Location SDO can be related to an Identity or Intrusion Set to indicate that the identity or intrusion set is located in that location. It can also be related from a malware or attack pattern to indicate that they target victims in that location. The Location object describes geographic areas, not governments, even in cases where that area might have a government. For example, a Location representing the United States describes the United States as a geographic area, not the federal government of the United States.

 

At least one of the following properties/sets of properties MUST be provided:

?      region

?      country

?      latitude and longitude

 

When a combination of properties is provided (e.g. a region and a latitude and longitude) the more precise properties are what the location describes. In other words, if a location contains both a region of northern-america and a country of us, then the location describes the United States, not all of North America. In cases where a latitude and longitude are specified without a precision, the location describes the most precise other value.","If precision is specified, then the datum for latitude and longitude MUST be WGS 84 [WGS84].

malware.png,malware.csv,malware,Malware,"Malware is a type of TTP that represents malicious code. It generally refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually covertly. The intent is to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system (OS) or otherwise annoy or disrupt the victim.

 

The Malware SDO characterizes, identifies, and categorizes malware instances and families from data that may be derived from analysis. This SDO captures detailed information about how the malware works and what it does. This SDO captures contextual data relevant to sharing Malware data without requiring the full analysis provided by the Malware Analysis SDO.

 

The Indicator SDO provides intelligence producers with the ability to define, using the STIX Pattern Grammar in a standard way to identify and detect behaviors associated with malicious activities. Although the Malware SDO provides vital intelligence on a specific instance or malware family, it does not provide a standard grammar that the Indicator SDO provides to identify those properties in security detection systems designed to process the STIX Pattern grammar. We strongly encourage the use of STIX Indicators for the detection of actual malware, due to its use of the STIX Patterning language and the clear semantics that it provides.","To minimize the risk of a consumer compromising their system in parsing malware samples, producers SHOULD consider sharing defanged content (archive and password-protected samples) instead of raw, base64-encoded malware samples.",https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_s5l7katgbp09,"{

observed-data.png,observed-data.csv,observed-data,Observed-Data,"Observed Data conveys information about cyber security related entities such as files, systems, and networks using the STIX Cyber-observable Objects (SCOs). For example, Observed Data can capture information about an IP address, a network connection, a file, or a registry key. Observed Data is not an intelligence assertion, it is simply the raw information without any context for what it means.

 

Observed Data can capture that a piece of information was seen one or more times. Meaning, it can capture both a single observation of a single entity (file, network connection) as well as the aggregation of multiple observations of an entity. When the number_observed property is 1 the Observed Data represents a single entity. When the number_observed property is greater than 1, the Observed Data represents several instances of an entity potentially collected over a period of time. If a time window is known, that can be captured using the first_observed and last_observed properties. When used to collect aggregate data, it is likely that some properties in the SCO (e.g., timestamp properties) will be omitted because they would differ for each of the individual observations.

 

Observed Data may be used by itself (without relationships) to convey raw data collected from any source including analyst reports, sandboxes, and network and host-based detection tools. An intelligence producer conveying Observed Data SHOULD include as much context (e.g. SCOs) as possible that supports the use of the observed data set in systems expecting to utilize the Observed Data for improved security. This includes all SCOs that matched on an Indicator pattern and are represented in the collected observed event (or events) being conveyed in the Observed Data object. For example, a firewall could emit a single Observed Data instance containing a single Network Traffic object for each connection it sees. The firewall could also aggregate data and instead send out an Observed Data instance every ten minutes with an IP address and an appropriate number_observed value to indicate the number of times that IP address was observed in that window. A sandbox could emit an Observed Data instance containing a file hash that it discovered.","Observed Data may also be related to other SDOs to represent raw data that is relevant to those objects. For example, the Sighting Relationship object, can relate an Indicator, Malware, or other SDO to a specific Observed Data to represent the raw information that led to the creation of the Sighting (e.g., what was actually seen that suggested that a particular instance of malware was active).

 

To support backwards compatibility, related SCOs can still be specified using the objects properties, Either the objects property or the object_refs property MUST be provided, but both MUST NOT be present at the same time.",https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_p49j1fwoxldc,"{

For example, an analyst from a consuming organization might say that they ""strongly disagree"" with a Campaign object and provide an explanation about why.

tool.png,tool.csv,tool,Tool,"Tools are legitimate software that can be used by threat actors to perform attacks. Knowing how and when threat actors use such tools can be important for understanding how campaigns are executed. Unlike malware, these tools or software packages are often found on a system and have legitimate purposes for power users, system administrators, network administrators, or even normal users. Remote access tools (e.g., RDP) and network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap) are examples of Tools that may be used by a Threat Actor during an attack.

 

The Tool SDO characterizes the properties of these software tools and can be used as a basis for making an assertion about how a Threat Actor uses them during an attack. It contains properties to name and describe the tool, a list of Kill Chain Phases the tool can be used to carry out, and the version of the tool.","This SDO MUST NOT be used to characterize malware. Further, Tool MUST NOT be used to characterize tools used as part of a course of action in response to an attack.",https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_z4voa9ndw8v,"{

vulnerability.png,vulnerability.csv,vulnerability,Vulnerability,"A Vulnerability is a weakness or defect in the requirements, designs, or implementations of the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and some hardware components (e.g., firmware) that can be directly exploited to negatively impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of that system.

 

CVE is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that provides common names for publicly known problems [CVE]. For example, if a piece of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.","The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of malicious cyber activity.
