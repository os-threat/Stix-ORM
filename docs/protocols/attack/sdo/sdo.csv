They differ in that they have a boolean field (x_mitre_is_subtechnique) marking them as sub-techniques, and a relationship of the type subtechnique-of where the source_ref is the sub-technique and the target_ref is the parent technique. A sub-technique can only have 1 parent technique, but techniques can have multiple sub-techniques.","Additionally:
- Sub-technique ATT&CK IDs are a suffix of their parent IDs. For a given sub-technique ID Txxxx.yyy, Txxxx is the parent technique ID and yyy is the sub-technique ID. Sub-techniques have unique STIX IDs.
- Sub-techniques have the same tactics as their parent technique.
- Sub-techniques have a subset of their parent technique's platforms.
- Sub-techniques only exist in the Enterprise and Mobile domains.",https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-stix-data/blob/master/USAGE.md#sub-techniques,"{
