relationship.svg,relationship.png,relationship-table.csv,relationship,Relationship,"The Relationship object is used to link together two SDOs or SCOs in order to describe how they are related to each other. If SDOs and SCOs are considered ""nodes"" or ""vertices"" in the graph, the Relationship Objects (SROs) represent ""edges"". STIX defines many relationship types to link together SDOs and SCOs. Relationship types defined in the specification SHOULD be used to ensure consistency. An example of a specification-defined relationship is that an indicator indicates a campaign. That relationship type is listed in the Relationships section of the Indicator SDO definition.","Relationships have a relationship_type field, which specifies the name of that particular type. In TypeDB, Relationships are modelled as a relation called stix-core-relationship, with attributes, where the source_ref and target_ref are materialised into actual roles. The name of the relationship_type property becomes the name of a sub-type of the stix-core-relationship, and role-names used are individual for each indivudal rolepointing to source and target.. Thus Relationships can be matched in TypeQL based on the parent object, stix-core-relationship, or the individual relationship tye name.",https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_e2e1szrqfoan,"{

sighting.svg,sighting.png,sighting-table.csv,sighting,Sighting,"A Sighting denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator, malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen. Sightings are used to track who and what are being targeted, how attacks are carried out, and to track trends in attack behavior. Sighting is distinct from Observed Data in that Sighting is an intelligence assertion (""I saw this threat actor"") while Observed Data is simply information (""I saw this file""). When you combine them by including the linked Observed Data (observed_data_refs) from a Sighting, you can say ""I saw this file, and that makes me think I saw this threat actor""."," Sighting relationships relate three aspects of the sighting:

- What was sighted, such as the Indicator, Malware, Campaign, or other SDO (sighting_of_ref)
- Who sighted it and/or where it was sighted, represented as an Identity (where_sighted_refs)
- What was actually seen on systems and networks, represented as Observed Data (observed_data_refs)

In TypeDB, Sightings are represented as sub-types of stix-core-relationships, except linking 3 roles: where-sighted, sighting-of and observed.",https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_a795guqsap3r,"{
