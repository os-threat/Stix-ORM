impact.svg,impact-table.csv,impact,Impact,Incidents have Impacts that change over time. Events can cause or influence these Impacts which are in turn mitigated and potentially resolved by tasks performed as part of the incident response process.Change in Impacts over time is recorded in state-change sub-objects within Tasks or Event definitions,"The Impact SDO is currently an extension, but as there are many specific types of impacts with their own unique properties it emulates the File SCO through the use of STIX Extensions to provide the granular details of specific categories of impacts. As such every Impact MUST have an extension that has the same value of the impact_category property (Availability, Confidentiality, External, Integrity, Monetary, Physical or Traceability). This allows consumers to quickly validate their ability to process this category of impact and then load all of its specific details. The Impact SDO must be accopanied by its definition extension, which MUST use extension-definition—?7cc33dd6-f6a1-489b-98ea-522d351d71b9 as its extension ID.
