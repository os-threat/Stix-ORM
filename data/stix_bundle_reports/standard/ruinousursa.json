As a result of these attacks, numerous government websites were found to be either defaced or inaccessible. As a result of this, the government of [Ukraine formally accused Russia](https://thehackernews.com/2022/01/ukrainian-government-officially-accuses.html) of masterminding these attacks against their websites. \n\nA day later, public reporting outlined a new malware family, called [WhisperGate](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/15/destructive-malware-targeting-ukrainian-organizations/), that originally was observed on Jan. 13, 2022. This malware family disables Windows Defender Threat Protection, is destructive in nature and was discovered to target multiple organizations in Ukraine. Microsoft has publicly attributed the use of this custom malware family to a threat actor they refer to as DEV-0586.
