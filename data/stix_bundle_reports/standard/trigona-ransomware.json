Although this blog will be discussing this newer variant, Unit 42 is aware that there was a previously-unnamed variant of Trigona found in the wild in early 2022. \n\nDuring the incident response engagement, Unit 42 discovered Trigona\u2019s operator(s) obtained initial access to their target\u2019s environment, conducted reconnaissance, transferred malware via remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, created new user accounts, and deployed ransomware.\n\nTrigona\u2019s ransom notes are unique; rather than the usual text file, they are instead presented in an HTML Application with embedded JavaScript containing unique campaign IDs and victim IDs. \n\nFrom the ransom notes, we discovered that Trigona operator(s) further intimidate victims by threatening double extortion: in addition to encrypting files in the victims\u2019 system with a ._locked extension, the operator(s) claim to steal data. If victims do not pay the ransom demand, the operator(s) threaten to auction off the data. Trigona has a new name-and-shame extortion site that is, at the time of writing, available on the Surface Web.\n\nTrigona has infrastructure and capability that overlaps with Crylock ransomware. Both operations share a specific email address for victim\u2019s to contact. Also, there are similarities in the ransom note\u2019s format and content.\n", "published": "2022-08-10T20:49:29.033Z", "object_refs": ["intrusion-set--4aa7a157-3f8c-4f24-83e9-6b0c20d86172",
