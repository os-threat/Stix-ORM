However, evidence suggests that it has been in development since February. The Black Basta operator(s) use the double extortion technique, meaning that in addition to encrypting files on the systems of targeted organizations and demanding a ransom to make decryption possible, they also maintain a dark web leak site where they threaten to post sensitive information if an organization chooses not to pay the ransom.\n\nThe ransomware is written in C++ and impacts both Windows and Linux operating systems. It encrypts users\u2019 data using a combination of ChaCha20 and RSA-4096, and to speed up the encryption process, the ransomware encrypts in chunks of 64 bytes, with 128 bytes of data remaining unencrypted between the encrypted regions. The faster the ransomware encrypts, the more systems can potentially be compromised before defenses are triggered. It is a key factor affiliates look for when joining a Ransomware-as-a-Service group.\n", "published": "2022-08-10T20:49:29.033Z", "object_refs": ["intrusion-set--4aa7a157-3f8c-4f24-83e9-6b0c20d86172",
